abstract: Achieving high brightness and resolving vergence-accommodation conflict
  (VAC) have become essential for augmented reality (AR) displays. The former allows
  the displays to maintain excellent image contrast even under strong ambient light,
  whereas the latter ensures visual comfort and realistic depth perception for users.
  We target a high-brightness and VAC-free AR display that integrates a liquid crystal
  on silicon (LCoS) microdisplay with a spatial-multiplexing light field projector
  (LFP). To achieve the target, we develop an optical device that directs light for
  the LCoS microdisplay and, in the meantime, prevents the crosstalk between subviews
  of a light field emanated from the LCoS micro-display. Specifically, we propose
  a polarization-alternating beam splitter and design an LCoS-based LFP using the
  proposed beam splitter. The performance of the LCoS-based LFP is evaluated by brightness,
  illumination uniformity, image quality, crosstalk prevention, and depth of field.
  Experimental results show that the LCoS-based LFP provides high brightness exceeding
  300,000 nits, produces sharp images, and ensures uniform illumination with root
  mean square error as small as 0.0010. The working range of LCoS-based LFP for crosstalk-free
  light field projection is from 40 cm to infinity.
